# 🌿 GreenNFT (ShugitoClean)

A sustainability-themed NFT dApp built on the **Polkadot ecosystem (Moonbase Alpha)** to raise awareness and funding for eco-friendly initiatives.

---

### 🎯 Overview
**GreenNFT** allows users to mint “Green” NFTs — digital collectibles symbolizing real-world environmental contributions.  
Originally conceived as a learning project to explore **smart contract deployment with Hardhat** and **Moonbase**, it now serves as the foundation for a full public dApp under the **ShugitoBuilds** banner.

---

### 🧱 Current Milestone (v1)
✅ Local + Moonbase deployment complete  
✅ Solidity 0.8.20 HelloWorld base contract  
✅ Secure `.env` configuration and Hardhat setup  
🚧 Frontend (Vite + Tailwind + MetaMask) in progress

### 💡 Next Steps
- Build frontend UI with **Vite + TailwindCSS**
- Add MetaMask wallet connection and mint button
- Store NFT metadata on **IPFS / Pinata**
- Add mint fees and donation routing
- Deploy to **Moonbeam Mainnet**
