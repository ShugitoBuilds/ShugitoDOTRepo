# ShugitoDOTRepo

This repository contains **DOT-FlowMap**, a single-file HTML demo. The page visualizes recent DOT transfers using D3-Sankey and TailwindCSS.

To try it out, open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve it with any local web server (for example `python3 -m http.server`).

Currently no automated tests exist.
